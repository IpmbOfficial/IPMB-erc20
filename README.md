# IPMB ERC20 Token

**IPMB** is an ERC20 token deployed on the Polygon blockchain, following OpenZeppelin's guidelines. The IPMB token supports minting, burning, and batch transfers. This repository contains the Solidity smart contract code for the IPMB token.

## Features

-   **ERC20 Standard**: IPMB adheres to the ERC20 token standard, making it compatible with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications.
-   **Minting**: Upon deployment, the contract mints a fixed supply of tokens to the deployer's wallet.
-   **Burning**: Token holders can burn their tokens to reduce the total supply, providing deflationary mechanics.
-   **Batch Transfers**: A convenient batch transfer function enables the transfer of tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction.
